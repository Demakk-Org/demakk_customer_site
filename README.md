`[TYPE-OF-CHANGE](SCOPE): [SHORT-DESCRIPTION]`. See examples below:

        chore(auth, profile): renamed auth and profile folders
        
        feat(profile): implement UI for basic information page
        
        feat(profile): implement UI for about me page
        
        fix(auth): fix login button not working
        
        style(profile): refined UI theme colors
2. Find the issue key for the Jira issue you want to link to, for example “JRA-123”. You can find the key in several places in Jira Software:
   - On the board, issue keys appear at the bottom of a card.
   - On the issue’s details, issue keys appear in the breadcrumb navigation at the top of the page.
3. Copy the branch name generated by Linear.
4. Checkout a new branch in your repo, using the issue key in the branch name. For example, (JRA-123-<branch-name>) for the branch name use the above convention
5. Make changes to the codebase.

7. When you create a pull request, use the issue key in the pull request title.
8. Push changes.
